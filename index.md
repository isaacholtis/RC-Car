RC Car perfection?

This is the ArduinoZig website, where we strive for perfection, in every thing we do, and make.

What kind of project is this?
We are trying to make an RC car out of an Arduino Nano, with a budget of less than $100 dollars over the whole project, and less than an hour a week of work from our team of three. As such, development is slow, but ongoing for our Remote Controlled car. We plan on having working prototypes by mid-March, with a somewhat complete package by sometime in May. The best way to check the development progress is to check our GitHub, which can be found here:

We'll also be posting when big strides in development occur in our blog section, which can be found within the top bar of this website. We can't make any commitments right now, but if you want to support what we're doing, you can use the button above to donate to our PayPal, which may or may not be used for RnD. ðŸ˜‰
